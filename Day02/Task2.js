//  Declare a variable without assigning a value. Print it. Then assign null to another variable and print it. What is the difference?

let a; //variable declared without init (take as undifined in the execution time by the system)
console.log(a);

let b= null; //variable is init as null (result will be shown as null)
console.log(b);

//undefined

//Variable is declared but no value is given. js assign it automatically

//null

// Variable is intentionally set to empty. Developer assign it manually
